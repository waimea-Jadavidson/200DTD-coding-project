### Level 2 Programming Project by Jasper Davidson

This project is assessed against [AS91896](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91896.pdf)

## Project Description

The project involves the programming of a two-player game.

This project is about the programming of the two or more player game 'Old Gold'.
The game is played on a one line grid with coins randomly placed across it.
Players take turns moving a coin any amount of spaces to the left without jumping over other coins.
If a coin/gold coin is in the first slot it can be removed from the board.
The player to remove the gold coin from the board is the winner.s
